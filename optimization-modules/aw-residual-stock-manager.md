long_description: >-
  This document describes the A+W Residual Stock Manager, a software solution
  for intelligently managing residual plates from cutting operations. It helps
  to reduce waste and maximize material usage by tracking and re-integrating
  leftover glass into the production process without the need for expensive
  mechanical storage systems.

# A+W Residual Stock Manager

## Manage leftover plates intelligently

In the flat glass industry, ever more high-quality and, therefore, expensive kinds of glass are being processed. The variety is increasing even as production throughput time is dropping, especially for LAMI. This means that the value of the partial sheets that are left after cutting is also increasing. What are you supposed to do with these?

> **Anyone who does not use residual plates is just giving money away!**

A good solution: Use a residual plate management system. The valuable first cuts are kept directly on the cutting line and can, if necessary, be incorporated quickly into the optimization. When you're using the A+W Realtime Optimizer, the leftover plates are incorporated automatically at the appropriate point during cutting.

But these mechanical storage systems represent significant investments. Careful amortization calculations are required in order to make the right business decision: is a residual sheet management system worth the price? It's not the optimal solution for every company.



## Keeping an eye on everything

In the "Residual Overview," the user can get a quick overview of the content of the manual storage, including the location, glass type, dimensions, sequence of the glass on the rack, etc. From here, you can also make changes. This way, the machine operator always has full control of the residual plates and can override decisions made by the system, if necessary.

Yes, unfortunately even RSM cannot overcome the laws of physics. Of course the user has a slight loss of productivity if - instead of simply pushing a jumbo across the cutting table, the operators have to manually remove a remnant and put it in a defined position - and there is additional productivity loss if a remnant has to be taken from a harp rack, and possibly, for larger sheets, moved by two workers and placed on the cutting table.

## Your benefits:

* No investment in expensive mechanical systems
* Reduction of manual search efforts
* Timely reprocessing
* Sequence consideration to minimize set-up time
* Use of a residual plate management system managed by A+W Residual Stock Manager possible across several cutting tables
* Use in combination with mechanical systems is possible with good results
