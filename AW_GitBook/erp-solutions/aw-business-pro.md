# A+W Business Pro: Integrated Production Control

A+W Business Pro is a fully integrated solution of the latest generation for small and medium-sized companies. The process from quotation to dispatch has never been easier!

## A+W Business Pro: Clear, simple, clever

### The "Pro" in the name:
A+W Business Pro is a professional and cost-effective entry-level solution for small and medium-sized companies where order processing and production planning are completely integrated.

### Business:
With the commercial part of the integrated solution (A+W Business), you can handle the entry of quotations, orders, credits, complaints, and delivery notes and manage orders and inquiries; you can also take control of other company areas (e.g. warehouse, purchasing, dispatch, etc.)

Using the integrated statistics module, you can create numerous customer and product-specific queries and evaluations. This helps you manage your product portfolio, as well as your purchasing and sales prices.

The system offers extensive technical support for the processing of quotations and orders. All elements are immediately displayed true-to-scale and graphically during entry in order to prevent entry errors and speed up the entire process. Price calculation with A+W Business is very flexible and allows division into standard prices and customer-specific terms.

The integration of the A+W Logistics Optimizer expands the ERP system to include complete route planning and control (incl. delivery app for the driver) and rounds out the entire package of possibilities in A+W in the areas of dispatch and logistics.

The possibility of incorporating a Webshop — A+W iQuote (G) — offers you the ability to create an additional 24/7 online sales channel and to manage it directly from your central system.

### Pro(duction):
Order data is available immediately for production planning. Thanks to the integrated wizard function, the process of batch creation and optimization, on through to production release can be completed with a single mouse-click.

The user can switch to "expert mode" at any time and influence the results directly. The cut optimization per batch and glass type is based on the latest algorithms and, thanks to the intelligent variation possibilities for storage space depth, selection of various stock sizes and residual plates, delivers very good results.

With the optional expansion A+W Capacity Planner (EL), you can determine production costs, processing and delivery dates - based on your real machine capacities - and write these back to the order all while communicating them to customers. This is how you can increase delivery reliability and customer satisfaction.

Thanks to the possibility of incorporating the easy, yet high-performance scanner solution A+W Barcode Manager (EL), you will achieve significant improvements and savings potential in stock and breakage management.

If your company grows more, there is an easy upgrade option to the premium solution "A+W Production," which enables a complete takeover of the existing and non-production-specific transaction data.

### Your benefits:
- Perfect entry-level solution: fully-integrated commercial and production solution, which thanks to many possible expansions, grows with you
- Easy, quick production processing and release with wizard function
- Low time and cost commitment thanks to intelligent and easy production control (e. g., production papers and standardized storage organization)
