# A+W Smart Delivery

## Deliver like a Pro

Digitize your delivery process and shorten billing cycles with the new A+W Smart Delivery app. Why waste valuable time printing delivery notes and obtaining physical signatures when the transactions can be recorded and transmitted straight into your database through the mobile delivery app?

When your customer signs electronically, A+W Smart Delivery confirms receipt of their order. Because the app automatically completes job tickets, you can issue the invoice immediately, so you'll receive payment at least one day earlier. Multiplied by numerous customers and orders, and the cash flow benefits can be significant!

### Delivery App
A+W Smart Delivery is an app-driven platform that provides real-time information about the status of your deliveries. Customers, drivers, and dispatch benefit thanks to greater visibility and need-based response management.

The process is simple: The driver accesses the order and item information, and the customer confirms or rejects the delivery via an electronic signature.

Upon a successful delivery, the order status is immediately updated in your A+W ERP system, enabling you to start the billing process. Valuable information, such as photographs of a damaged delivery, or a rack that has been unloaded at a construction site, can be automatically stored in the ERP system to document deliveries and increase transparency for both you and your customer.

### GPS Technology and Route Optimization
Do more with A+W Smart Delivery than just deliveries. Connect the app with Nokia Maps technology and an integrated rack management system to optimize the delivery and pick up of racks. These easy-to-sync features enable you to schedule efficient routes for drop off and pick up, whether you are in the office or on the road.

With minimal effort, A+W Smart Delivery can be upgraded to the A+W Logistic Optimizer, adding an intelligent route optimization tool and more. With A+W Logistics Optimizer, you can optimize routes via traffic information, schedule accurate delivery times, and even re-route around truck restrictions. These tools will increase driver reliability and provide savings in both time and transportation costs.

A+W Smart Delivery improves customer satisfaction with delivery confirmation while faster billing improves your cash flow and your bottom line.

### Your benefits:
- Scale your logistics solution according to your needs
- Use our modern delivery app as an electronic delivery note
- Accelerate subsequent processes after shipping by using online feedback (e.g. invoicing)
