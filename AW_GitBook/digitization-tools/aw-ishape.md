# A+W iShape

> Even faster, more accurate

## Digitize templates with a smartphone camera

For production of a non-rectangular sheet (shape, free form), glass processors frequently receive a hand drawing or a wood, chipboard, or cardboard template from the customer. However, modern production using a CNC machine requires digital data in order to define these shapes.

Older digitalization systems require special equipment and calibration, but this is expensive and time consuming. To address this challenge, glass processors need a simple, yet flexible solution for generating digital data from the template to the CNC machine.

A+W, in conjunction with Viprotron, has developed a user-friendly, easy-to-operate app for exactly this purpose called A+W iShape. The template is fitted with L-shaped reference objects and then photographed with a high-end smartphone camera. The reference objects, high-quality precision metal pieces, are placed on the template or fastened to it. They serve to correct any distortions when photographing.

What makes A+W iShape special? In contrast to older solutions, no calibration of the camera is required! A+W iShape works with any good smartphone camera. You take the photo, the photo is deblurred and transformed into a stream of points and, if you are using a smartphone, displayed for immediate checking together with the detected contour.

Once the image is transferred to A+W CAD Designer, the stream of points is converted to a shape defined by arcs and straight lines, which is used for further processing. Here, thanks to the displayed deblurred picture, you can manually correct the contour, if needed. For example, corners on images can be distorted, so you can easily correct corners in A+W CAD Designer.

For further processing, machine data or DXF files can be generated. Overall, the entire recording process takes just a few minutes.

## Your benefits:

- Quick, reliable digitalization of templates
- High-end smartphone camera is sufficient for recording
- No calibration required
- Reliable compensation for distortions thanks to the reference object
- Quick transfer to CNC machines
