# A+W Production: Everything under control

Thanks to its great flexibility, clarity and deep integration into your production, you always have your production processes fully under control – from planning and optimization right up to packaging and delivery.

## A+W Production: Everything perfectly planned and optimized

### Everything perfectly planned
An expanded product line and state-of-the-art machines are placing ever-higher demands on organizational concepts, as well as planning and control software. These machines, which are highly complex and sensitive high-tech systems, enable high cycle rates and quick throughput times, but only if the overall concept is right and the production process is optimally planned and controlled. Therefore, scalable software systems and integrated solutions are the key to an optimized production environment.

A+W Production is an extremely flexible PPS solution for complete rough and detailed scheduling for insulated glass, tempered glass, and laminated glass production. The system allows planning and control of even the most demanding multi-level production flows.

The latest improvements within capacity planning and scheduling, such as campaign planning, simplified rescheduling possibilities, and improved scheduling algorithms, have expanded A+W Production's functionality and simplified the daily business of production management and work preparation.

### A+W Production functionalities
The system can be configured for all production areas, machines, and material flow organizations. Information (e.g., about status and quantity changes) is reported back to the ERP system. Employees in order processing and sales can answer customer inquiries quickly, reliably, and in an up-to-date fashion. Delivery bottlenecks are reorganized and adjusted when necessary.

The basic version of A+W Production includes production and close-to-machine rough and detailed scheduling, optimization, machine assignment, and production release, as well as the creation of production papers and labels. In addition to consideration of machine restrictions and specifications for production control, various manufacturers' inspection programs can be incorporated, which guarantees feasibility.

The machine assignment guarantees the primary machine and production alternatives so that, if needed, another system can be used for production. The rough planning provides an overview of the production orders in order to hand these over to production in suitable lots.

### Your benefits:
- Management of production flows and multi-level production based on 40+ years of worldwide experience
- Intelligently balanced optimization: waste and sequencing
- Optimization as well as rack and stack organization and optimization
- Everything under control thanks to individual lite tracing and production status/progress control
- Simple, graphic machines and capacity management (including WIP) and direct machine control

The special feature of A+W Production rough planning is the quantity/product-oriented regarding of the units to be put into production according to various criteria.

Within detailed scheduling, the production sequence and storage spaces are specified automatically for all parts and processings to be produced. The sequence can arise according to pre-defined organization forms due to customer specifications, results of a packaging optimization, or production technical restrictions.

A+W Production Terminal is an ideal complement to A+W Production. It is a software module for online control, visualization, and monitoring of production flows.

A+W Production can use various grouping and sorting functions to determine precisely how individual lites and units must be distributed on racks in order to keep all items for a customer order or all individual lites of a unit together. And this all happens before the first lite is cut.

> Thanks to the many possibilities for modular expansion and customizing, A+W Production is very scalable – the system adjusts to your needs and grows with you.
