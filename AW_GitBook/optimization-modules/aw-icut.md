# A+W iCut: Software for Glass

## Enter orders, Optimize cutting, & Manage storage

Are you looking for a state-of-the-art, cost-effective IT solution that automates your most-used functions in the office, storage, and cutting? Then A+W iCut could become your new integrated software system â€“ perhaps the first step toward digitalizing your company.

### Clever entry-level solution for your operation
A+W iCut is a compact solution for insulated glass manufacturers and glass processors that is integrated into commercial programs with state-of-the-art cutting optimization. Use A+W iCut to enter orders and optimize your glass cutting; manage your glass storage and use automatic synchronization with optimization. After cutting, all while A+W iCut automatically updates your inventory. A+W iCut works based on the MS-SQL Express database.

### Easy order entry
With A+W iCut, you create customers and products easily and quickly and use a clear interface to enter IG, TG, LAMI, and other glass types. For calculation of the correct cutting dimensions, you enter the required edge processings. Do you need to enter a shape? No problem - the standard shapes in the A+W shape catalog are available. For the entry of shaped sheets that are not included in the A+W shape catalog (shape 99), there is a DXF import function. All of this together allows you to calculate the total price for the order based on the item prices entered.

### Intelligent cut optimization
For experienced users, there is also expert mode, which permits control of the individual planning and optimization steps, and thus also of the optimization results.

All commercially available cutting tables can be controlled with A+W iCut optimization. Edge decoating is supported. With appropriate additional drivers, you can also control additional cutting tables.

Broken sheets are re-optimized manually with A+W iCut. Of course, there are also functions for label printing and visualization of cutting plans.

With all of these functions, A+W iCut optimization proves its value as a high-quality, state-of-the-art solution, all at a very reasonable price.

## Your benefits:

**Order entry**
- Entry of IG, LAMI, TG, and individual sheets
- Entry of edge processings (for calculation of the correct cutting dimensions)
- Entry of standard shapes from the A+W shape catalog
- Calculation of the total order price based on manually entered item prices
- DXF import during order entry with shape 99

**Storage**
- Manual stock receipt bookings
- Automatic stock removals through optimization

**Optimization/use of residual sheets**
- The system offers the opportunity to create and maintain storage of residual plates.

## Do you want more?

One of the best properties of A+W iCut: when your requirements increase, your software solution can "grow along with your needs" if you'd like it to. For example, an upgrade to A+W Business Pro is possible at any time, if your company grows, if you have to manage more customers and products, or if you need more workstations and functions.

But you can also integrate optional add-ons for your existing A+W iCut, such as barcoding/sheet tracing, and A+W iShape for quick and easy digitalization of templates.
