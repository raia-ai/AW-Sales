# A+W DynOpt

A+W DynOpt is a dynamic optimization system for controlling automatic cutting and sorting lines. The latest A+W DynOpt systems also ensure the seamless communication between cutting and downstream, online-connected production lines.

## A+W DynOpt functionalities

A+W DynOpt allows the simultaneous cutting and breaking of several glass types. The system controls and synchronizes several cutting tables, sorting buffers, and residual lite management systems all while ensuring real-time data exchange with other production systems, such as the insulated glass line.

In combination with a dynamically-controlled intermediate buffer (for example, HEGLA SortJet), a continuous flow of glass is now possible, while also allowing rush orders and remakes to be inserted in a timely fashion with a constant waste ratio. A+W DynOpt couples the previously manual or semi-automatic production flows so that they are completely automatic and thus generates a long-term uninterrupted flow of glass.

## How does A+W DynOpt work?

The current generation of A+W DynOpt makes it feasible to exchange glass types and optimize for storage on A-racks, when necessary.

> *A+W Production is a complete production planning and control system for insulated glass, TG, and LG production as well as for multi-level production environments. The basic version of A+W Production includes production as well as close-to-machine rough and detailed scheduling, machine assignment, formula editor, and production release.*

## Your benefits:

- Improved efficiency of the cutting lines
- Less breakage and damage during cutting and sorting
- Improvement of production-synchronized handling and breakage as well as the integration of rush jobs
- No limits on the size of a production lot (from individual lites through to daily production)
- Controlled output onto one or more harp racks or directly onto one or more insulated glass lines
- Calculates the best way to optimize your fully automatic production line
- Generates a continuous glass flow
- Automatic control of sorters, buffers, and residual plate storage
- Automatic load distribution across several production lines
- Intelligent process optimization through the use of algorithms for perfect, individually-attuned loading of your buffer system
- Everything under control: based on graphic displays, such as planned and current work stock
