long_description: "This document describes the A+W Realtime Optimizer, an online cut calculator that provides flexibility to production flows after optimization has already been performed. It allows for chaining, splitting, and recombining batches, re-routing to different cutting tables, and integrating breakages in real-time, all while retaining the specified storage sequences."

# A+W Realtime Optimizer: Flexible cut calculator

## Your benefits:
- Continuous material flow between cutting and downstream processes
- Consideration of the production sequence arising from fine planning
- Reduction in residual lites by filling up partial lites with rush orders, breakage remakes, or with lites from a freely-selectable, follow-up optimization system
- Dynamic reoptimization of any breakage
- Online control of the cutting tables and breakage displays

## Overcoming Inflexible Production Flows

The fine planning instruments used in glass production and optimization systems today provide good to very good results thanks to many years of constant enhancement. Nevertheless, it is clear that there is still significant savings potential, especially in the area of glass cutting. Simple optimization systems for state-of-the-art process flows are generally too rigid and inflexible, meaning glass must be cut as specified in the original optimization sequence. However, it's possible to do things differently!

The online cut calculator, A+W Realtime Optimizer, allows flexible and wide-reaching interventions into production flows even after an optimization has already been performed. A+W Realtime Optimizer can chain batches, split up large batches, and recombine them. Optimization flows can be divided up or re-routed to different cutting tables online and breakages are integrated easily. The already-specified storage sequences are, therefore, retained, while the production sequence of the basic optimization is not changed.

## The Residual Plate: Problem Lite or Valuable Material?

At many companies, residual plates are regarded with scorn due to time pressures in production and because a large part of the raw material lands in the breakage container. The handling of residual plates is complicated and blocks a lot of valuable machine time so that cutting systems are frequently poorly utilized. The poor utilization then wreaks havoc with the cutting performance that would theoretically be possible with the cutting system.

With the A+W Realtime Optimizer, you can use residual plates that arise in real time, that is, in the ongoing cutting process, for example by feeding in broken lites online. The breakage must only be selected for the remake in the cutting plan, which is displayed via a monitor.

## Real-Time Optimization and Integration

Depending on the configuration, breakage can be reported to production at any registration point and considered in the online remaking. Residual plate management systems, such as the HEGLA Remaster, are optimally incorporated into the online control, which allows you to use these valuable sections as efficiently as possible.

With the A+W Realtime Optimizer, optimization flows can be divided up and shifted to different cutting lines. Here too, the storage sequence is maintained.
