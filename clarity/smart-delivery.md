# A+W Smart Delivery

## Deliver like a Pro

Digitize your delivery process and shorten billing cycles with the new A+W Smart Delivery app. Why waste valuable time printing delivery notes and obtaining physical signatures when the transactions can be recorded and transmitted straight into your database through the mobile delivery app?

When your customer signs electronically, A+W Smart Delivery confirms receipt of their order. Because the app automatically completes job tickets, you can issue the invoice immediately, so you'll receive payment at least one day earlier.

### Delivery App
A+W Smart Delivery is an app-driven platform that provides real-time information about the status of your deliveries. The process is simple: The driver accesses the order and item information, and the customer confirms or rejects the delivery via an electronic signature.

### GPS Technology and Route Optimization
Connect the app with Nokia Maps technology and an integrated rack management system to optimize the delivery and pick up of racks. With minimal effort, A+W Smart Delivery can be upgraded to the A+W Logistic Optimizer, adding an intelligent route optimization tool.

### Your benefits:
- Scale your logistics solution according to your needs
- Use our modern delivery app as an electronic delivery note
- Accelerate subsequent processes after shipping by using online feedback (e.g. invoicing)
