# A+W Residual Stock Manager

## Manage leftover plates intelligently

In the flat glass industry, ever more high-quality and, therefore, expensive kinds of glass are being processed. The variety is increasing even as production throughput time is dropping, especially for LAMI. This means that the value of the partial sheets that are left after cutting is also increasing.

> **Anyone who does not use residual plates is just giving money away!**

A good solution: Use a residual plate management system. The valuable first cuts are kept directly on the cutting line and can, if necessary, be incorporated quickly into the optimization.

## Keeping an eye on everything

In the "Residual Overview," the user can get a quick overview of the content of the manual storage, including the location, glass type, dimensions, sequence of the glass on the rack, etc. This way, the machine operator always has full control of the residual plates and can override decisions made by the system, if necessary.

## Your benefits:

* No investment in expensive mechanical systems
* Reduction of manual search efforts
* Timely reprocessing
* Sequence consideration to minimize set-up time
* Use of a residual plate management system managed by A+W Residual Stock Manager possible across several cutting tables
