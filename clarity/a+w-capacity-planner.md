# A+W Capacity Planner

## Keep a grip on production capacities

The A+W Capacity Planner handles the planning and control of existing production capacities in direct and permanent synchronization with the capacities reserved for the order stock.

This allows early detection of production bottlenecks and intervention into the planning results. In addition, there is a check of the desired delivery date. If the desired delivery date is not possible or cannot be adhered to, then the system checks whether it is possible to produce using alternative resources. If there should be no alternative machines or if their capacity is not sufficient, then the system calculates the earliest possible alternative delivery date taking into consideration the route schedule from the ERP system/department.

Planning and calculation are done on the basis of the current and/or expected production utilization (reservations) per machine, unit, or work area. The basis is the master data stored per machine in the form of times, the shift or deployment plans per company or per machine, and the assigned costs per machine and technology.

All scheduled orders are assigned to the existing capacities (machines and dates), according to the glass types and processings defined in the order.

At the same time, the production costs per work run and for all alternative means of production are determined in detail. Only the selected technology with its costs and, if necessary, the recalculated dates are reported to the ERP system, and the data is updated to the order.

Detailed evaluations per area, per machine, and per order item are also possible. A central capacity monitor assists with the control of utilization, allowing quick intervention in case of capacity bottlenecks, overruns, and work backlogs.

The A+W Capacity Planner comes both as a professional add-on for A+W Production as well as an entry-level solution for A+W Business Pro.

A+W Capa View is the ideal complement to the A+W Capacity Planner. This allows your commercial and sales employees to view online how much of your production capacity is being used, even across locations.

Simple and intelligent rescheduling helps you with required manual intervention into current production planning and to transfer individual work processes to alternative machines or another shift due to machine maintenance.

In connection with the A+W Barcode Manager, daily capacities are displayed in the production monitor according to production progress. This add-on is only available in connection with A+W Production.
