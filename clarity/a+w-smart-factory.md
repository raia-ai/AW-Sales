# A+W Smart Factory

## Coordinate process flows completely automatically

Complex, highly automated production is posing ever higher requirements of software. It increasingly includes comprehensive production intelligence. It controls people and machines just-in-time in networked processes, shortens throughput times, and increases product quality. This is how self-controlling production environments are created.

A+W SmartFactory is a completely newly developed, scalable production system, a higher-level production system that controls processes completely automatically for an optimized glass flow and networks people, machines, software, and products. It is in a position to responsively coordinate all coupled machines and software modules with the production data provided. In the process, machine clients communicate flexibly with the system via so-called A+W SmartFactory clients; this allows control of the machine status and machine capacity of machines that are connected directly. Planning is done in real time, and it can be adjusted at any time, so that it is almost always possible to deliver precisely on time. This way, batches that are already in production can be prioritized after the fact. The intelligence required for this lies only in the software that controls the communication between machines, and also between machines and human beings.

A+W SmartFactory is based on the “pull principle,” which is suitable for highly complex flat glass processing environments. The production control systems previously used in the flat glass industry use JIT (just-in-time) tools for reverse capacity planning. After the planning, today’s systems are used to group production into batches and push these batches through production, typically beginning with the cutting process. As a result, there are many batch-size conflicts that restrict efficiency, and greater challenges in managing last-minute changes.

However, A+W SmartFactory is based on the so-called “pull principle,” which forms the core of an A+W patent that was originally developed for an automatic sorting system. This principle has been expanded to work in a complex production environment that consists of several sorters and production cells. The result is a minimal quantity of WIP (work in progress) that generates the batches as the result of production at the end (dispatch), whereby the intermediate batches are formed dynamically based on the current situation within the workflow.

With A+W SmartFactory, real-time production data can be read from the machines; this makes your production planning much more precise and allows you to draw conclusions based on machine performance, bottlenecks, etc. – in other words, your planning basis is what is actually happening in your production. With the A+W IoT Smart Trace data platform, you can combine data provided by the machines, enrich it with data from PDC, and evaluate it on a clear dashboard. Your company will become more transparent.

Thanks to the modular structure of A+W SmartFactory, you can minimize the risks of a system conversion. The toolbox principle makes it possible to convert just part of a production, and to proceed step by step.

A+W SmartFactory networks people, machines, software, and products. If there are no possibilities for direct machine communication, A+W SmartFactory clients function as imitation machines that can determine status and capacity per machine thanks to the integrated plant data collection. This way, even less-automated companies can profit from this development.

A+W SmartFactory therefore helps smaller companies to grow and advances automation at large companies.
