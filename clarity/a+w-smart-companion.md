# A+W Smart Companion

## Scan smarter with Smart Devices

The bar code scanner has long since established itself as an indispensable tool in the flat glass industry. From goods receipt in the warehouse to status registration in production to delivery confirmation; data is recorded via bar code scanning and transmitted to commercial and production systems.

However, the industrial scanner as we know it is quickly becoming obsolete. Smart devices equipped with the A+W Smart Companion app, great computing power, and outstanding graphics algorithms will soon replace it.

A+W Smart Companion assists users along the entire value-creation chain, contributing to its digitalization and saving time and money, for processes become more flexible. The hardware can be any modern smartphone or the TC20 smart device from Zebra. In addition to all the features that distinguish a smartphone, it also has a hardware-supported bar code scanner. The app works on Android and iOS devices.

A+W Smart Companion can scan several bar codes at once, e. g. edge compound labels on a rack, which saves a lot of time. Work is more productive and there are fewer errors.

And A+W Smart Companion can be used not only as a bar code scanner, but also as a mobile info terminal. Employees can use it to display the locations of order components and the content of racks since communication becomes bidirectional. Thanks to the display of data on-site, employees have to run around less, so they do less unproductive work.

The production employees’ bookings are available online in A+W Production for further processing. Therefore, planning with real-time data is also possible in shipping.

If an employee isn’t connected to the network, data is recorded securely in offline mode. As soon as there is a connection, data is transferred automatically.

The current version is the production module of A+W Smart Companion. In the future, there will be variants for different areas such as the warehouse and shipping. A+W Smart Companion represents a completely new product generation, which, like other current A+W solutions, was designed with mobile application in mind.

## Stock management and inventory

First there was the production module of the A+W Smart Companion; now there is a Stock & Inventory module, which provides paperless stock management and inventory.

Analog methods make transferring information about incoming goods and stock data to your commercial system and recording important parts for production time-consuming and subject to errors. Only continuous digital booking of incoming stock and stock transactions enables reliable data management between the warehouse, commercial system, and production.

Thanks to the new stock module, it is now possible to digitalize all stock management with the A+W Smart Companion app. Smart devices serve as scanner hardware to enter incoming and outgoing stock, rebookings, and changes, etc.

The stock module of the A+W Smart Companion enables secure booking of incoming goods for stock and production, even in case of partial deliveries. Items can be shifted in the stock, stock items removed with or without an order. The A+W Smart Companion creates an online log of the stock transactions, which is displayed clearly in the intuitive user interface.

And there’s a special treat: when using the stock module, production items are booked into the A+W Enterprise commercial system and the A+W Production system with just a click – previously, these bookings had to be made individually.

For inventory, the stock module’s inventory function provides useful filters, checklists, and dashboards, including a to-do list and various charts. Your employees can trace precisely what has already been taken care of and what remains to be inventoried.

Thanks to the digitalized inventory campaign, employees in the warehouse can continue working without any disturbances. This inventory module is also sold separately.
