# A+W DynOpt

A+W DynOpt is a dynamic optimization system for controlling automatic cutting and sorting lines. The latest A+W DynOpt systems also ensure the seamless communication between cutting and downstream, online-connected production lines.

## A+W DynOpt functionalities

A+W DynOpt allows the simultaneous cutting and breaking of several glass types. The system controls and synchronizes several cutting tables, sorting buffers, and residual lite management systems all while ensuring real-time data exchange with other production systems, such as the insulated glass line.

In combination with a dynamically-controlled intermediate buffer, a continuous flow of glass is now possible, while also allowing rush orders and remakes to be inserted in a timely fashion with a constant waste ratio.

## Your benefits:

- Improved efficiency of the cutting lines
- Less breakage and damage during cutting and sorting
- Improvement of production-synchronized handling and breakage as well as the integration of rush jobs
- No limits on the size of a production lot
- Generates a continuous glass flow
- Automatic control of sorters, buffers, and residual plate storage
