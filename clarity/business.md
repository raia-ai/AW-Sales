### A+W Business Functionalities
A+W Business is a complete ERP system for small- and medium-sized companies in the flat glass industry.

The A+W commercial solution allows for not only the entry of quotations, orders, credit notes, complaints, delivery notes, and the management of purchase orders and inquiries, but it also allows for control of other company areas (e. g., stock, purchasing, and dispatch). The main functions of A+W Business are master data management, quotation creation, order processing, creation of partial deliveries and complaints, and all associated documents and evaluations.

### Graphical Interface and Ease of Use
With its graphic interface, A+W Business is easy and quick to use, while also simplifying all company-internal processes related to order processing.

### Integration and Expansion
If you are using the A+W Production suite, production information is also available in A+W Business. This includes customer inquiries about delivery date, production utilization, and production process, all of which can be answered quickly and precisely.

### Your benefits:
- **Time and cost savings** thanks to automation of the processing of orders and quotations.
- **Prevention of errors and quick processing** thanks to a graphical user interface.
- **Increased quality and customer satisfaction** due to online overviews and inquiries about production utilization, production progress during order entry, and delivery status in the course of route monitoring.
