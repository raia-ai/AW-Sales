long_description: "This document describes the A+W Realtime Optimizer, an online Cut Calculator that provides flexibility to production flows after optimization has already been performed. It allows for chaining, splitting, and recombining batches, re-routing to different cutting tables, and integrating breakages in real-time, all while retaining the specified storage sequences."

# A+W Realtime Optimizer: Flexible cut calculator

## Your benefits:
- Continuous material flow between cutting and downstream processes
- Consideration of the production sequence arising from fine planning
- Reduction in residual lites by filling up partial lites with rush orders, breakage remakes, or with lites from a freely-selectable, follow-up optimization system
- Dynamic reoptimization of any breakage
- Online control of the cutting tables and breakage displays

## Overcoming Inflexible Production Flows

The online cut calculator, A+W Realtime Optimizer, allows flexible and wide-reaching interventions into production flows even after an optimization has already been performed. A+W Realtime Optimizer can chain batches, split up large batches, and recombine them. Optimization flows can be divided up or re-routed to different cutting tables online and breakages are integrated easily.

## Real-Time Optimization and Integration

With the A+W Realtime Optimizer, you can use residual plates that arise in real time, that is, in the ongoing cutting process, for example by feeding in broken lites online. Residual plate management systems are optimally incorporated into the online control, which allows you to use these valuable sections as efficiently as possible.
