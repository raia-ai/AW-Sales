long_description: "This document describes the A+W Defect Optimizer, a solution that works with Viprotron scanners to scan stock plates for defects before cutting begins. The system then considers these defects during optimization to create a new or restructured cutting pattern, reducing waste and improving quality by preventing flawed lites from entering production."

# A+W Defect Optimizer

## Detect and consider defects even before cutting

### The Challenge: Costly Defects Discovered Too Late

Do your customers complain about flawed lites/windows after installation? Statistically, every second jumbo lite has a defect. However, inclusions and defects on stock and residual lites are frequently detected only very late, for example, during quality control before/after IGU assembly or, in the worst case, at the customer.

### The Solution: Intelligent Pre-Cutting Optimization

Why not detect and consider defects in the optimization stage even before cutting?

- Together with Viprotron scanners, we scan the stock plate and detect defects even before cutting starts.
- Defects are considered during optimization for a new or restructured cutting pattern.
- Required sequences are considered in the optimization process.
- Information about defects in residual plates is stored and can be used again later without another check.

## Your benefits:

- Increased quality thanks to defect prevention
- Significant cost reduction by early defect detection
- Prevention of processing on already defective lites
- Selection of suitable suppliers through quality controls
- Increasing of delivery reliability
