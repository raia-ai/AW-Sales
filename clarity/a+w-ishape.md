### Digitalize templates with a smartphone camera

For production of a non-rectangular sheet (shape, free form), glass processors frequently receive a hand drawing or a wood, chipboard or cardboard template from the customer. Modern production on CNC machines requires digital data in order to define these shapes.

Glass processors need a simple and flexible solution for generating digital data from the template. Older digitalization systems require special equipment and calibration – but this is expensive and time-consuming.

A+W, in conjunction with Viprotron, has developed a user-friendly, amazingly easy-to-operate app for exactly this purpose – A+W iShape. The template is fitted with L-shaped reference objects and then photographed with a high-end smartphone camera. The reference objects, high-quality precision metal pieces, are placed on the template or fastened to it. They serve to correct any distortions when photographing.

The special feature: in contrast to older solutions, no calibration of the camera is required! A+W iShape works with any good smartphone camera. You take the photo, the photo is deblurred and transformed into a stream of points and, if you are using a smartphone, displayed for immediate checking together with the detected contour.

In the A+W CAD Designer, the stream of points is converted to a shape defined by arcs and straight lines, which is used for further processing. Here, thanks to the displayed deblurred picture, it is also possible to manually correct the contour (frequently the corners of a shape are damaged. They can be replaced easily with correct corners in the reworking).

For further processing, machine data or DXF files can be generated. The entire recording process takes just a few minutes.
