# A+W Logistics Optimizer

## Intelligent route planning and delivery

Customers measure a supplier‘s quality by the quality of its delivery logistics. They expect deliveries to be punctual, complete, and of course in perfect condition. The A+W Logistics Optimizer ensures smooth route planning and delivery.

This intelligent logistics software creates and optimizes the shortest routes – taking into consideration your real fleet and the order data transmitted. The system will then tell you – given route limitations (e.g. bridge height, environmental zones, or permissible vehicle weight) and traffic information – the optimal route with the optimal sequence of delivery points.

Different delivery addresses can also be considered, as can specific time and date promises made to customers and the required unloading times. The weight to be delivered is distributed across the trucks so that each delivery point has to be visited just once – and so the most appropriate truck for the route is always selected automatically.

On the one hand, our solution offers you the opportunity to plan quickly and easily; on the other hand, its various options and parameters allow you to find the best possible delivery result. The planned costs are calculated for the routes (time, personnel, fuel), and these can be compared to the actual costs after successful delivery. Planning results and the proportional cost shares for orders can be reported back to the ERP system.

The A+W Logistics Optimizer includes a comprehensive statistics and analysis tool for optimizing your logistics processes. However, the system does more than just assist with route planning and evaluation; it also assists you with delivery and its documentation. Thus on the one hand you can export the route data to the navigation system; on the other hand, you can use the A+W Smart Delivery app on a smartphone to book the delivery and report it back to the office in real time, complete with signature.

There, the dispatch manager can monitor the delivery of the route online. Broken sheets can be scanned and are reported directly to the ERP system, where they can be remade immediately. If the delivery is OK, the order can be invoiced right away, saving the supplier time and money.

The system also supports the delivery and pick-up of additional racks. Racks that are ready for pick-up are displayed on the map and pick-ups can be planned into the route.

The A+W Logistics Optimizer includes interfaces to TomTom WebFleet and Rio.Cloud.

## A+W Freight Optimizer

The A+W Freight Optimizer is an add-on to the A+W Logistics Optimizer that ensures optimized loading of your delivery vehicles. It can handle all common means of packaging (dispatch racks, boxes, etc.). Depending on the glass measurements, the system even searches for the most suitable rack.

You determine whether the truck’s maximum cargo capacity should be used or whether a particular sequence should be considered for load optimization. The system will make a loading proposal that you can modify taking into account the specified restrictions.

The A+W Freight Optimizer also “knows” which types of packaging you can stack. Of course you can override the recommendations of the A+W Freight Optimizer manually at any time.

By using the A+W Logistics Optimizer and the A+W Freight Optimizer, you not only increase customer satisfaction thanks to perfect deliveries but you also save a lot of money in dispatch and logistics since the software handles the time-consuming route and loading planning for you. And this makes it work better and faster than any experienced dispatcher could do with traditional tools.
