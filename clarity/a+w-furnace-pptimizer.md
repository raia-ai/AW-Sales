# A+W Furnace Pptimizer

## Allotting furnace beds optimally

The maximum utilization of the furnace bed makes TG production more efficient and cost-effective. In many cases, this cannot be done manually or it is very time-consuming. The results are poorly allocated furnace beds, higher energy, and higher labor costs.

Additionally, reliable lite tracing is also difficult. Employees must always re-measure in order to be sure which lite is actually the one in question and where the pre-tempered lites must be stored at the furnace exit.

With A+W Furnace Optimizer, the capacities of the TG furnace are used as efficiently as possible, thus making lite tracking easier. This online optimization works with only the lites that are currently available at the furnace entrance. Since these lites were booked in networked production via PDC for the previous processing of the TG production, the furnace manager can identify each lite with a simple barcode reading and position it in the current furnace batch according to the specifications of the A+W Furnace Optimizer. The optimized batch is displayed reliably on the A+W Production Monitor at the furnace entrance. After production, the batch will be registered as “produced” with a barcode reading. The employee at the furnace exit receives precise information about where each lite should be stored.

Furthermore, A+W Furnace Optimizer makes re-production in case of breakage easier. If, by contrast, furnace beds were allocated “intuitively,” the identification and assignment of the relevant lite would not always be easy, especially in case of furnace batches with several lites that are similar in size and shape.

### How it works — identify

Lites available at the furnace entrance are identified (booked in networked production via PDC). Each lite can be identified by a barcode reading.

{% step %}
### How it works — position

The A+W Furnace Optimizer positions each identified lite in the current furnace batch according to optimization specifications to maximize furnace bed utilization.

### How it works — display

The optimized batch is displayed on the A+W Production Monitor at the furnace entrance for the operator to follow.

### How it works — register

After production, the batch is registered as “produced” with a barcode reading.

### How it works — store

The employee at the furnace exit receives precise information about where each produced lite should be stored, simplifying tracking and re-production in case of breakage.

## Save and evaluate furnace data centrally

With the A+W Furnace Optimizer, you already have the prerequisites for production with Industry 4.0 functions. So, if you are using the A+W IoT Smart Trace system, the batch information together with other machine data can be saved centrally and evaluated. In many cases, this enables the evaluation and optimization of furnace times and the detection of reasons for breakage. It is easier to see whether batches and individual lites are forwarded reliably and quickly to the next technology after TG production or whether they “stand around” unnecessarily for a long time.
