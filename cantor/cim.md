# A+W Cantor CIM

## Capacity Planning and Delivery Date Calculation

### Capacity Planning: Resources Under Control

Provide an exact delivery date when sending an order confirmation to your customer. This unique scheduling tool takes into consideration your production capacity and the required materials. You will see a graphic depiction of the activities necessary to complete the order; placing the order generates the correct material requirements plan for your purchasing department, automatically.

### Just-in-Time and On-Time Delivery

When can a new customer order be delivered on-time, complete and as quickly as possible while, at the same time, causing as little cost as possible for material procurement or storage?

Just-in-time planning answers this question straight away. Every order goes through this planning process so that the order confirmation can be printed with the precise delivery date.

Just-in-time planning is at the heart of A+W Cantor software. It calculates the dates of upcoming tasks for all worksteps in all departments.

## CIM – Paperless Production

### Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM)

Reduce errors and communicate changes quickly and effectively with up-to-date and accurate work instructions on view at every workstation. Flexible monitor views make it possible to adjust each monitor to the specific needs of the workstation. Production data is optimally visualized for your employees, and the digital job card is always available. Perform material requests, rework, and quality control checks with in-house production control directly at the A+W Cantor CIM terminal.

### Barcoding Adds Visibility

Thanks to the use of barcodes, your production can be tracked in real time. With seamless parts traceability and a graphical representation of machine capacity, you can monitor the "who, what, where, and when" of your manufacturing operation.

### Full Control at the Master Workstation

Create your own personal overview in the production dashboard. This lets you see the status (and location) of every element, which workstations are occupied or are malfunctioning, and whether a production buffer is below required levels. Views can be individually configured and are always up to date, ensuring that the requirements for a working quality management system are met.

### Your Benefits:

- Efficient and transparent production processes

- Time savings from barcode efficiencies

- No more searching for materials or customer orders

- Optimum throughput times

- Information is always available when you need it

- No more errors due to outdated documentation

- Integrated, in-house production control

## Delivery and Loading Planning

### Improve Your On-Time Delivery Performance with Shipping Controls

### No More Searching When Loading

As early as the production planning phase, A+W Cantor can take the loading sequence of your shipping racks into account. Pick lists contain the storage locations of your products and all ancillary parts to ensure that each truck leaves your premises without any avoidable backorders. All deliveries contain the necessary documents such as directions, customer contact information, delivery notes, etc.

If a delivery route consists of several stops, the loading and, hence, the unloading sequence will be optimized to the delivery route. Truck capacities, order weights, loading areas of units and early delivery dates for a location or region are also considered when planning delivery routes.

Early delivery dates is just one item that can affect the sequence of production. With the full integration of A+W Cantor, this can be taken into account at an early stage in the process, and production can begin as soon as capacity is available. This ensures that all products are produced "just-in-time" based on the delivery date and sequence.

### Complete Deliveries, Guaranteed

A+W Cantor offers inventory control for finished goods, accessories and purchased items with stock management. Organization of accessories in particular ensures that only full deliveries are shipped to your customers. Increase customer satisfaction by ensuring complete, on-time deliveries!

### Rack Management and Retrieval

With integrated rack management, you always know where your racks are. No rack is lost, and you can schedule the retrieval of your racks in delivery planning.

### Your Benefits:

- Time savings, as you no longer need to search for finished elements

- Nothing from the order is left behind, thanks to packing organization

- Optimum service, delivery reliability and quality

- Cost and time savings from optimum route planning

## Service and Installation Planning

### Securely Schedule and Monitor Your Service and Installation Teams

When you create an order in A+W Cantor, a planning process is automatically initiated. Production schedules are taken into consideration. Your department has a full overview of which orders need to be scheduled.

The program automatically provides key data in the planning process for the employees in your planning department – such as the required time and the installation material needed for the order.

Efficient planning makes optimum use of the capacities of your service and installation teams. This also makes it possible to take geographical criteria into consideration when combining teams.

Installation teams receive all necessary information with the week's plan. Appointments can be automatically transferred to the Outlook calendars of the installation staff.

In addition, the integration of **OpenStreetMap** offers graphic support when visualizing the stops on the route.

Once installation has been completed, you have the opportunity to enter the actual time consumed. This lets you compare the planned and actual times and create statistical evaluations by job or by crew, as well as to better estimate future installations.

### Your Benefits:

- Reliable planning: Do you know what your installation team is going to be doing in 6 weeks?

- Increased customer satisfaction thanks to reliable scheduling

- Data for planning, estimating and combining teams

- Visibility and full overview of all workflows
