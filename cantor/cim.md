# A+W Cantor CIM

## Work Preparation and Production Control

### Optimum Processes in Production

Map your production capacities with the help of A+W Cantor. Flexibly assign jobs to make optimum use of your production lines. With cutting optimization, you save material and time, as you can plan the cutting of your profiles to ensure that waste is reduced to an absolute minimum. The software communicates with your entire machine pool, putting your equipment to optimum use.

## CIM – Paperless Production

### Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM)

Reduce errors and communicate changes quickly and effectively with up-to-date and accurate work instructions on view at every workstation. Flexible monitor views make it possible to adjust each monitor to the specific needs of the workstation. Thanks to the use of barcodes, your production can be tracked in real time.

## Delivery and Loading Planning

### Improve Your On-Time Delivery Performance with Shipping Controls

As early as the production planning phase, A+W Cantor can take the loading sequence of your shipping racks into account. If a delivery route consists of several stops, the loading and, hence, the unloading sequence will be optimized to the delivery route. With integrated rack management, you always know where your racks are.

## Service and Installation Planning

### Securely Schedule and Monitor Your Service and Installation Teams

When you create an order in A+W Cantor, a planning process is automatically initiated. Efficient planning makes optimum use of the capacities of your service and installation teams. This also makes it possible to take geographical criteria into consideration when combining teams. Appointments can be automatically transferred to the Outlook calendars of the installation staff.
