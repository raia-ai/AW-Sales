# A+W Cantor ERP

## Quote and Order Processing

### All Items in Just One Order

With A+W Cantor, your commercial and technical orders are always complete and tested. Whether you are making windows out of wood, aluminum, or PVC – and in standard or custom sizes and configurations – Quote and Order Processing makes it possible to include all materials in just one order. You can even create alternative quotes with just the click of a button – ideal for quoting with different types of materials/series to better support good-better-best scenarios.

Configure your order item, starting with the individual lite all the way to the complete element. Enter and change the glass and all of its components in order entry. Glass selection can be restricted using technical value criteria.

### Comprehensive Pricing Function

The comprehensive pricing function takes the burden from your staff and ensures that the correct price is always offered, including current promotions (e.g., Free Low-E upgrade).

### Variant Configurator with Full Flexibility

Our unique variant configurator combines the rigid world of an industry specific configurator with the flexible world of a standard ERP system. With this system you have the opportunity to define your individual configurator with all the requirements and rules that specifically apply to your company. This way, you stay flexible, so: if the framework conditions change, you simply adapt the configurator.

### A+W Cantor CAD – Special Design Made Easy

The software features a simplified, quick entry screen with numerous built-in shape templates to suit a majority of projects. For special or complex shapes, A+W Cantor CAD allows you to freely design custom shapes and still have the system make a detailed price calculation.

### Global Business, Thanks to Multilingual Capabilities

A+W Cantor software includes multiple languages, so you can support your customers in their preferred languages. This feature may open up new markets where translation was previously required.

### Order Change During Production

For orders, parts of which are already in production, change orders can be used to modify or even cancel all items from order groups (e.g., order group doors) for which no jobs have been formed yet. The changes from the change order are then copied back to the original order without resetting the status of the original order.

### Always on Top of Key Projects

Do you sell large commercial or residential projects? With A+W Cantor Project Management Module, you can create more transparency in your project-related quotes and orders.

### Remake/Repair

With A+W Cantor, a remake order of a customer's product or sub component (e.g., IGU) can be generated with just a few clicks, maintaining a permanent reference to the original order.

### Supports Multiple Sites

If you produce in several plants at different locations, or you manage a multi-company structure, you will appreciate A+W Cantor's multi-site and multi-company capabilities. Multiple sites may include any combination of commercial/ordering sites, production sites, and/or logistics sites. As early as the order entry phase, products are automatically distributed to specific plants. Logistics centers can also be integrated into the process chain.

### Finances: Accounts Under Control

Even before you create an order confirmation, A+W Cantor performs a credit limit check on every order. The system automatically performs billing and, while doing so, communicates directly with the financial accounting department. You always know what's going on with your payables as well as your receivables.

### Your Benefits:

- A correct order, quickly and securely

- Everything in one order, even with a mix of products or materials

- Always correct prices – including custom designs

- Comprehensive ordering and multilingual capabilities

- Highest flexibility, thanks to the unique variant configurator

## Processes and Management

### Leaner, Optimized Processes

Improve the process throughput for your entire company.

### Defined Workflow

Workflows are used to individually structure, portray, and design your processes. For instance, you can set up a status booking of "advanced payment required" which, when a payment is received, would then release the order for further processing.

### Always Make Sound Decisions

Use the A+W Cantor tools to prepare detailed information saved in the system. With the integrated SQL tool, you can create queries to portray, analyze, and optimize every area of your business. The system is built on an open database, so you can access every piece of information that is stored there.

### Task Management

A+W Cantor has an integrated task management tool which supports you in prioritizing daily tasks. It automatically contacts responsible people or groups, who are assigned to specific actions, and communicates between departments. You can use the tool to manage your entire corporate process flow.

### Personalized Dashboards

Configure your own personal dashboard to manage your business. The system provides you with business-wide, real-time evaluations as a basis for your decisions. In a single glance, see your top customer orders, average time to manufacture, and your accounts receivables, or any other metrics to help keep you up to date on the current throughput and cash position of your business.

### Info Center Creates Transparency

The integrated Info Center is automatically created for each order. All order information is saved there. Each action, each edit, and each status change made to an order is recorded – together with user data and a date/time stamp.

Information on purchasing, goods receiving, delivery planning, commercial handling, and all other relevant order information is included. This enables your staff to give customers accurate information on the status of an order at all times.

### Document Archive

Documents created by the system (e.g., quotes, order confirmations, etc.) are automatically stored in the document archive. In addition, you also have the opportunity to automatically or manually store further information, such as the measurement sheet. The assignment of archived documents can be order-, customer-, or supplier-based.

### Your Benefits:

- Sound business decisions based on reliable, recent data

- Demonstrates competence to your customers with complete order data stored in the Info Center

- Improved transparency by storing all documents in the system

- Traceable information for communication between departments

- Paperless office organization

- Lean management, thanks to the high efficiency of each work step

## Purchasing and Materials Management

### Minimum Capital Tie-Up as a Result of Optimized Order Processes

### Needs-Based and Just-in-Time Material Planning

Lean manufacturing facilities operate on a just-in-time basis so that orders for required materials can be placed and delivered as late as possible … or as early as necessary.

A+W Cantor knows your inventory levels and reserve at all times, taking even the smallest material movement into consideration. Your inventory levels are, therefore, managed to an optimum level at all times.

For all order-related purchased materials, the software automatically generates orders with prices for the respective suppliers based on current order data.

**EDI and openTRANS®** supports your automated order management process as well as the electronic communication with your suppliers. Incoming invoices are checked for accuracy; manual intervention is only required if there are deviations in the order.

The receipt and exit of goods can be booked automatically or by using a mobile scanner.

### Your Benefits:

- Higher liquidity with less capital tied up in inventory

- Planning security as a result of transparent order processes

- Time savings, as the system automatically determines order quantities

- No bottlenecks from missing material

- Low inventory stocks

- Seamless invoice verification
