# A+W Cantor Dealer Cloud

## A+W iQuote (F) – Webshop

### From the Webshop to Production to Delivery

**Easy for your customers. Even easier for your company!**

### Speed and Simplicity at the Touch of a Fingertip

Today, customers demand service whenever it suits them. They want the ability to search and order products around the clock. A+W iQuote gives your customers the power to check quotes and place orders directly with your company anytime and anywhere – Whether at a building site, in the office, or on the go. Giving your customers access according to their schedule will enhance your relationships, build loyalty, and optimize your processes.

### Complete Integration with A+W Cantor

Before A+W iQuote, online ordering often required glass manufacturers to update a second database and re-enter orders. With A+W iQuote, those days are over.

A+W iQuote communicates directly with your A+W Cantor system so that ordering is centralized. The integration creates seamless communication among your customers, dealers, and manufacturers for full transparency and accountability.

### Faster Order Handling – Shorter Delivery Times

Web-based order processing results in faster order handling and shorter delivery times, streamlining everything. Manufacturers and customers save time and money. Smaller dealers don't need their own software since they work in the window manufacturer's A+W iQuote system with the very latest data.

For new and existing customers, the interface is simple and easy to use. When customers log into your system, you can control which products they choose for configuration based upon availability and price, among other factors. Your dealers and sales staff can quickly offer both standard elements and complex configurations depending on what your customers need most.

### Digital Worlds Are Growing Together

Another trend in the window industry is the incorporation of suppliers' online shops. For a long while, we have been cooperating with well-known manufacturers of shutters and front door inserts. Now we have incorporated the online configurators of **adeco, dpi, OBUK, Rodenberg, ROMA, and WAREMA** into A+W iQuote. If your dealer enters an exterior door using A+W iQuote, he can use the manufacturer's configurator, select the insert there so that the price is calculated, transfer this information to A+W iQuote, and display the result graphically.

### Production-Ready Ordering

The products that your customers order through A+W iQuote are fully compliant with your A+W Cantor system. That makes it easy to ensure that the products that your customers configure are always current and that prices are calculated correctly. This guarantees that the products ordered via A+W iQuote are ready for production now. You and your customers can track the orders through your A+W Cantor system, providing full transparency through every stage of delivery. Better yet, full optimization means there is no double entry of orders. It's that easy.

### A Mobile Web-Based System

Through the A+W iQuote system, your customers can manage their quotes and orders as well as customer data, price group discounts, individual delivery conditions and forms of payment, etc. and send quotations and order confirmations including graphics to their customers. A+W iQuote works on all platforms (Windows, iOS, Android), browsers (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox) and end devices (PC, laptop, tablet, smartphone).

### Adaptable Design

The A+W iQuote design can be adapted individually to match your company's style or preference. Better yet, your webshop can seamlessly integrate onto a company homepage.

### Networking Within the Industry – Cloud Access

The A+W iQuote Webshop can be called up as a configurator, either from an A+W iQuote system operated by a market partner or optionally from A+W Cantor quotation and order entry or a third-party ERP window construction program. This way, a construction element manufacturer can call up a supplier's integrated A+W iQuote Webshop (for example, that of a roller shutter manufacturer) and work with the customer to custom-configure roller shutters for a window already entered.

### Your Benefits:

- No redundant data storage and maintenance for the Webshop

- Development of new sales channels and customer groups

- Easy-to-use interface – no training required

- Price calculations and buildability checks – as in A+W Cantor order entry

- Direct provision of Webshop POs to production planning

- Much shorter time-to-market for new products thanks to web-based provision of the configuration
