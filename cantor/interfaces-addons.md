# Interfaces & Add-ons

## Interfaces to Third Party Systems and Machines

A+W Cantor provides an integrated solution for virtually all window, door, and shutter manufacturing tasks, yet there are areas where the system makes use of other tools that are connected via interfaces.

### Financial Accounting Software

The interface between A+W Cantor and your accounting software transmits master data information, postings, income, and expense accounts to your accounting systems, and open items and payment entries are transmitted back. All incoming and outgoing invoices are taken into consideration. A+W already offers interfaces to all established accounting systems, such as **DATEV, Diamant, Sage**, and many more.

### Design Software

The integration of **LogiKal, KKP and SchüCal** into A+W Cantor offers all the benefits of LogiKal in the aluminum sector as well as efficient control of all processes in the system. Companies that work in different product segments can enter and comprehensively manage order items from both systems in a single software solution. This means that your customer receives just one order confirmation that includes all products.

### Purchasing/External Web Configuration

In purchasing, **openTRANS® and EDI** are frequently used for automatic order management and electronic communication. The integration of web configurators for **adeco, dpi, OBUK, Rodenberg, ROMA, and WAREMA** reduces the work required for master data maintenance. These configurators also provide direct access to your suppliers' current product lines, which optimizes your order process since product configuration is verified to ensure that it is technically feasible. Your orders are placed electronically, they are error-free and contain all the necessary characteristics at the stored purchasing conditions.

### Systems for the Glass Industry

Currently, A+W Software has integrated solutions from **Lisec and glas online**, as well as the company's own **Clarity systems**.

### Machine Interfaces

Machine interfaces are programmed individually by A+W and controlled via A+W Cantor.

### Delivery Planning Software

The integration of the **PTV Mapserver, TRAMPAS, OpenStreetMap**, and the company's own **A+W Logistics Optimizer** provides access to the functionalities of these solutions.

### Other Interfaces

The **MS Office connector** enables the export of data from A+W Cantor for further processing.

With a digital document management system (DMS), you can improve the efficiency of everyday workflows at your company. Your employees' managing of digital documents will make their lives much easier.

### Revision-Proof Archiving

Archive your data so that you are in compliance with GAAP and GDPR. All documents generated by A+W Cantor (quotations, order confirmations, invoices, delivery notes, etc.) are written automatically to the A+W Cantor DMS system. In addition, you can archive your e-mail, construction drawings, and all of your correspondence.

### Don't Waste Time Searching

Finding a document is as easy as doing a Google search. You can search by customer number or quotation/order number, regardless of whether you're looking for an e-mail, delivery note or quotation.

### Work Without Paper

You can avoid paper completely by saving all documents in your digital archive. Thanks to the complete integration into your A+W Cantor system, you can call up the documents from A+W Cantor. Your customer and project folders become entirely digital.

### Many Additional Add-On Modules

With A+W Cantor DMS, you have access to many other DocuWare modules that will make your work more efficient, for example, digital signatures on the delivery note.

### Your Benefits:

- Faster, smoother information flow

- No searching, so you have more time for your important work

## A+W Cantor Smart Companion

### Scan Smarter with the Smartphone

The barcode scanner has established itself as an indispensable tool in industry and trade – and also long since in the window, door, and roller shutter industry. From goods receipt to status booking in production on through to delivery to the customer, data is recorded and transferred to ERP systems via barcode reading.

However, there are alternatives to the industrial scanner as we know it, namely smartphones and other smart devices that are equipped with the **A+W Smart Companion app**.

### A Smart Companion for All Cases, Easier and Cheaper

A+W Smart Companion supports your entire value-creation chain and contributes to its digitalization – so you save time and money. Scanning via smartphone app is easier than with conventional scanners and cheaper too. A+W Smart Companion can fulfill all requirements in the window construction industry without any of the disadvantages of traditional scanner hardware.

Replace specialized, expensive hardware with a familiar mobile device that you use every day. This will also save you time, for no training is required.

The user interface is very simple. You can select everything immediately: the camera mode, the read mode. This simplicity and speed of operation is very important for all employees.

### Mobile Info Terminal

The app can also be used as a mobile info terminal. For example, you can display the locations of order components and the content of racks, for communication becomes bidirectional.

Invalid bookings due to incorrect read sequence of the barcodes are prevented since the A+W Smart Companion guides the user. This significantly increases read quality.

Another benefit: with the A+W Smart Companion, you can scan several barcodes at a time, e.g. for element labels on a rack. This represents a significant time savings. Work is more productive and fewer errors are made.

### Your Benefits:

- Scan, inform, evaluate – securely and efficiently

- Use on mobile, user-friendly devices

- No learning curve: familiar hardware that everybody uses every day

- Runs on iOS and Android

- Depending on requirements, can be used on various smart devices

- Scanning of several barcodes in continuous mode

- Simpler workflows for employees increase productivity

## Integration with A+W Clarity – Software for Glass

A+W is a full-service provider of software for the manufacture of windows, doors and flat glass. A+W is the only manufacturer to offer integrated solutions for window and glass manufacturers and also highly integrate solutions for order processing between the window fitters and insulating glass supplier.

### Manufacture of Construction Elements with Own Glass Production

If you, as a window fitter, are your own glass supplier, the integration of A+W Cantor with the A+W production system, **A+W Production for glass**, is the perfect solution for you.

A+W Production for glass makes it possible for you to optimally plan and control your glass manufacturing. Both systems feature paper-free production. Alongside automatic transmission of the necessary glass data, another special feature of integration is complete transfer of insulating glass units from glass production to the window line.

### Integration with Your Glass Supplier

This integration also works beyond company limits: When creating windows and doors, all required features are generated for the manufacture of the glass. Glass data from A+W Cantor is automatically transferred to the software via an interface. Both systems compare their information using the sequence and rack position of the glass. With A+W Production, the glass manufacturer is capable of producing and documenting the sequence required by the window fitter.

### Production Control and Monitoring

The window fitter's A+W Cantor software provides the glass supplier with clear sorting identification (e.g., via EDI), concerning the:

- Production line

- Production batch

- Over/under sizes not suitable for pane buffers

- Extremely long delivery times (Tempered glass, processed glass) used to be ordered and sorted

- Separate delivery – glazing on building sites

Panes that are manufactured with A+W Software often display two barcodes: The glass manufacturer's internal one used by A+W Production to guide the glass correctly through the insulating glass production and the second one, which contains information for the window fitter's production logistics. Modern window fitting software, such as A+W Cantor, will generate the barcode information when the glass is ordered and transfer the order via EDI.

Due to the fact that the pane is identified by the barcode registration in the window fitter's system, it can be localized when glazing by scanning the barcode applied to "its" corresponding leaf – the barcode label contains all necessary information and guides the pane exactly when it is needed.
