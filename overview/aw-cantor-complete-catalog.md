### A+W Cantor – The Comprehensive Software Solution

What does state-of-the-art software have to do at construction element companies today? A whole lot, of course, but one characteristic may absolutely not be lacking: the comprehensive nature of the system, which has to map all flows on a platform, from initial customer inquiry on through to confirmation and delivery.

A+W Cantor is the complete, comprehensive software solution that addresses the market-specific requirements of **window, door, roller shutter, gate, and insect screen manufacturers**; it can be used in all areas of a company. Thanks to its modular structure, you can select exactly where you want to use A+W Cantor and you can grow with us.

#### Continuous Business Process Mapping

The business process is mapped continuously in A+W Cantor: from quotation creation to order entry including credit limit check, purchasing and materials management, to production, delivery, on through to service and installation planning and invoicing. All order handling can be done nearly paperlessly using the integrated document archive. For your trade partners, the dealer solution **A+W Cantor Dealer Cloud** and the **A+W iQuote (F) Webshop** are available; the latter is being used increasingly for quick, secure ordering 24/7.

#### Transparency and Organization

A+W Cantor creates transparency at your company and thus the ideal prerequisites for maintaining an overview and working on-time and according to demand at all times. You can always see the status of each order in production and in the office, so that you can provide customers with information right away and there is no more time-consuming searching in paper folders in production.

Rely on A+W Cantor's organizational talent and never forget any accessories, special glass or parts with long delivery times. A+W Cantor will be glad to remind you: even just after entry of the order, A+W Cantor calculates all dates, from PO to installation date, and it notes these on the individual departments' calendars.

## A+W Cantor ERP

### Quote and Order Processing

#### All Items in Just One Order

With A+W Cantor, your commercial and technical orders are always complete and tested. Whether you are making windows out of wood, aluminum, or PVC – and in standard or custom sizes and configurations – Quote and Order Processing makes it possible to include all materials in just one order. You can even create alternative quotes with just the click of a button – ideal for quoting with different types of materials/series to better support good-better-best scenarios.

Configure your order item, starting with the individual lite all the way to the complete element. Enter and change the glass and all of its components in order entry. Glass selection can be restricted using technical value criteria.

#### Comprehensive Pricing Function

The comprehensive pricing function takes the burden from your staff and ensures that the correct price is always offered, including current promotions (e.g., Free Low-E upgrade).

#### Variant Configurator with Full Flexibility

Our unique variant configurator combines the rigid world of an industry specific configurator with the flexible world of a standard ERP system. With this system you have the opportunity to define your individual configurator with all the requirements and rules that specifically apply to your company. This way, you stay flexible, so: if the framework conditions change, you simply adapt the configurator.

#### A+W Cantor CAD – Special Design Made Easy

The software features a simplified, quick entry screen with numerous built-in shape templates to suit a majority of projects. For special or complex shapes, A+W Cantor CAD allows you to freely design custom shapes and still have the system make a detailed price calculation.

#### Global Business, Thanks to Multilingual Capabilities

A+W Cantor software includes multiple languages, so you can support your customers in their preferred languages. This feature may open up new markets where translation was previously required.

#### Order Change During Production

For orders, parts of which are already in production, change orders can be used to modify or even cancel all items from order groups (e.g., order group doors) for which no jobs have been formed yet. The changes from the change order are then copied back to the original order without resetting the status of the original order.

#### Always on Top of Key Projects

Do you sell large commercial or residential projects? With A+W Cantor Project Management Module, you can create more transparency in your project-related quotes and orders.

#### Remake/Repair

With A+W Cantor, a remake order of a customer's product or sub component (e.g., IGU) can be generated with just a few clicks, maintaining a permanent reference to the original order.

#### Supports Multiple Sites

If you produce in several plants at different locations, or you manage a multi-company structure, you will appreciate A+W Cantor's multi-site and multi-company capabilities. Multiple sites may include any combination of commercial/ordering sites, production sites, and/or logistics sites. As early as the order entry phase, products are automatically distributed to specific plants. Logistics centers can also be integrated into the process chain.

#### Finances: Accounts Under Control

Even before you create an order confirmation, A+W Cantor performs a credit limit check on every order. The system automatically performs billing and, while doing so, communicates directly with the financial accounting department. You always know what's going on with your payables as well as your receivables.

#### Your Benefits

* A correct order, quickly and securely
* Everything in one order, even with a mix of products or materials
* Always correct prices – including custom designs
* Comprehensive ordering and multilingual capabilities
* Highest flexibility, thanks to the unique variant configurator

### Processes and Management

#### Leaner, Optimized Processes

Improve the process throughput for your entire company.

#### Defined Workflow

Workflows are used to individually structure, portray, and design your processes. For instance, you can set up a status booking of "advanced payment required" which, when a payment is received, would then release the order for further processing.

#### Always Make Sound Decisions

Use the A+W Cantor tools to prepare detailed information saved in the system. With the integrated SQL tool, you can create queries to portray, analyze, and optimize every area of your business. The system is built on an open database, so you can access every piece of information that is stored there.

#### Task Management

A+W Cantor has an integrated task management tool which supports you in prioritizing daily tasks. It automatically contacts responsible people or groups, who are assigned to specific actions, and communicates between departments. You can use the tool to manage your entire corporate process flow.

#### Personalized Dashboards

Configure your own personal dashboard to manage your business. The system provides you with business-wide, real-time evaluations as a basis for your decisions. In a single glance, see your top customer orders, average time to manufacture, and your accounts receivables, or any other metrics to help keep you up to date on the current throughput and cash position of your business.

#### Info Center Creates Transparency

The integrated Info Center is automatically created for each order. All order information is saved there. Each action, each edit, and each status change made to an order is recorded – together with user data and a date/time stamp.

Information on purchasing, goods receiving, delivery planning, commercial handling, and all other relevant order information is included. This enables your staff to give customers accurate information on the status of an order at all times.

#### Document Archive

Documents created by the system (e.g., quotes, order confirmations, etc.) are automatically stored in the document archive. In addition, you also have the opportunity to automatically or manually store further information, such as the measurement sheet. The assignment of archived documents can be order-, customer-, or supplier-based.

#### Your Benefits

* Sound business decisions based on reliable, recent data
* Demonstrates competence to your customers with complete order data stored in the Info Center
* Improved transparency by storing all documents in the system
* Traceable information for communication between departments

#### Minimum Capital Tie-Up as a Result of Optimized Order Processes

#### Needs-Based and Just-in-Time Material Planning

Lean manufacturing facilities operate on a just-in-time basis so that orders for required materials can be placed and delivered as late as possible … or as early as necessary.

A+W Cantor knows your inventory levels and reserve at all times, taking even the smallest material movement into consideration. Your inventory levels are, therefore, managed to an optimum level at all times.

For all order-related purchased materials, the software automatically generates orders with prices for the respective suppliers based on current order data.

**EDI and openTRANS®** supports your automated order management process as well as the electronic communication with your suppliers. Incoming invoices are checked for accuracy; manual intervention is only required if there are deviations in the order.

The receipt and exit of goods can be booked automatically or by using a mobile scanner.

#### Your Benefits

* Higher liquidity with less capital tied up in inventory
* Planning security as a result of transparent order processes
* Time savings, as the system automatically determines order quantities
* No bottlenecks from missing material
* Low inventory stocks
* Seamless invoice verification

### Delivery and Loading Planning

#### Improve Your On-Time Delivery Performance with Shipping Controls

#### No More Searching When Loading

As early as the production planning phase, A+W Cantor can take the loading sequence of your shipping racks into account. Pick lists contain the storage locations of your products and all ancillary parts to ensure that each truck leaves your premises without any avoidable backorders. All deliveries contain the necessary documents such as directions, customer contact information, delivery notes, etc.

If a delivery route consists of several stops, the loading and, hence, the unloading sequence will be optimized to the delivery route. Truck capacities, order weights, loading areas of units and early delivery dates for a location or region are also considered when planning delivery routes.

Early delivery dates is just one item that can affect the sequence of production. With the full integration of A+W Cantor, this can be taken into account at an early stage in the process, and production can begin as soon as capacity is available. This ensures that all products are produced "just-in-time" based on the delivery date and sequence.

#### Complete Deliveries, Guaranteed

A+W Cantor offers inventory control for finished goods, accessories and purchased items with stock management. Organization of accessories in particular ensures that only full deliveries are shipped to your customers. Increase customer satisfaction by ensuring complete, on-time deliveries!

## A+W Cantor Dealer Cloud

### A+W iQuote (F) – Webshop

#### From the Webshop to Production to Delivery

**Easy for your customers. Even easier for your company!**

#### Speed and Simplicity at the Touch of a Fingertip

Today, customers demand service whenever it suits them. They want the ability to search and order products around the clock. A+W iQuote gives your customers the power to check quotes and place orders directly with your company anytime and anywhere – Whether at a building site, in the office, or on the go. Giving your customers access according to their schedule will enhance your relationships, build loyalty, and optimize your processes.

#### Complete Integration with A+W Cantor

Before A+W iQuote, online ordering often required glass manufacturers to update a second database and re-enter orders. With A+W iQuote, those days are over.

A+W iQuote communicates directly with your A+W Cantor system so that ordering is centralized. The integration creates seamless communication among your customers, dealers, and manufacturers for full transparency and accountability.

#### Faster Order Handling – Shorter Delivery Times

Web-based order processing results in faster order handling and shorter delivery times, streamlining everything. Manufacturers and customers save time and money. Smaller dealers don't need their own software since they work in the window manufacturer's A+W iQuote system with the very latest data.

For new and existing customers, the interface is simple and easy to use. When customers log into your system, you can control which products they choose for configuration based upon availability and price, among other factors. Your dealers and sales staff can quickly offer both standard elements and complex configurations depending on what your customers need most.

#### Digital Worlds Are Growing Together

Another trend in the window industry is the incorporation of suppliers' online shops. For a long while, we have been cooperating with well-known manufacturers of shutters and front door inserts. Now we have incorporated the online configurators of **adeco, dpi, OBUK, Rodenberg, ROMA, and WAREMA** into A+W iQuote. If your dealer enters an exterior door using A+W iQuote, he can use the manufacturer's configurator, select the insert there so that the price is calculated, transfer this information to A+W iQuote, and display the result graphically.

#### Production-Ready Ordering

The products that your customers order through A+W iQuote are fully compliant with your A+W Cantor system. That makes it easy to ensure that the products that your customers configure are always current and that prices are calculated correctly. This guarantees that the products ordered via A+W iQuote are ready for production now. You and your customers can track the orders through your A+W Cantor system, providing full transparency through every stage of delivery. Better yet, full optimization means there is no double entry of orders. It's that easy.

#### A Mobile Web-Based System

Through the A+W iQuote system, your customers can manage their quotes and orders as well as customer data, price group discounts, individual delivery conditions and forms of payment, etc. and send quotations and order confirmations including graphics to their customers. A+W iQuote works on all platforms (Windows, iOS, Android), browsers (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox) and end devices (PC, laptop, tablet, smartphone).

#### Adaptable Design

The A+W iQuote design can be adapted individually to match your company's style or preference. Better yet, your webshop can seamlessly integrate onto a company homepage.

#### Networking Within the Industry – Cloud Access

The A+W iQuote Webshop can be called up as a configurator, either from an A+W iQuote system operated by a market partner or optionally from A+W Cantor quotation and order entry or a third-party ERP window construction program. This way, a construction element manufacturer can call up a supplier's integrated A+W iQuote Webshop (for example, that of a roller shutter manufacturer) and work with the customer to custom-configure roller shutters for a window already entered.

#### Your Benefits

* No redundant data storage and maintenance for the Webshop
* Development of new sales channels and customer groups
* Easy-to-use interface – no training required
* Price calculations and buildability checks – as in A+W Cantor order entry
* Direct provision of Webshop POs to production planning
* Much shorter time-to-market for new products thanks to web-based provision of the configuration

* Less coordination with your dealers
* Increased process efficiency
* Easier acquisition of new dealer customers and higher rate of customer retention
* Optimal support of your sales channel

## Interfaces & Add-ons

### Interfaces to Third Party Systems and Machines

A+W Cantor provides an integrated solution for virtually all window, door, and shutter manufacturing tasks, yet there are areas where the system makes use of other tools that are connected via interfaces.

#### Financial Accounting Software

The interface between A+W Cantor and your accounting software transmits master data information, postings, income, and expense accounts to your accounting systems, and open items and payment entries are transmitted back. All incoming and outgoing invoices are taken into consideration. A+W already offers interfaces to all established accounting systems, such as **DATEV, Diamant, Sage**, and many more.

#### Design Software

The integration of **LogiKal, KKP and SchüCal** into A+W Cantor offers all the benefits of LogiKal in the aluminum sector as well as efficient control of all processes in the system. Companies that work in different product segments can enter and comprehensively manage order items from both systems in a single software solution. This means that your customer receives just one order confirmation that includes all products.

#### Purchasing/External Web Configuration

In purchasing, **openTRANS® and EDI** are frequently used for automatic order management and electronic communication. The integration of web configurators for **adeco, dpi, OBUK, Rodenberg, ROMA, and WAREMA** reduces the work required for master data maintenance. These configurators also provide direct access to your suppliers' current product lines, which optimizes your order process since product configuration is verified to ensure that it is technically feasible. Your orders are placed electronically, they are error-free and contain all the necessary characteristics at the stored purchasing conditions.

#### Systems for the Glass Industry

Currently, A+W Software has integrated solutions from **Lisec and glas online**, as well as the company's own **Clarity systems**.

#### Machine Interfaces

Machine interfaces are programmed individually by A+W and controlled via A+W Cantor.

#### Delivery Planning Software

The integration of the **PTV Mapserver, TRAMPAS, OpenStreetMap**, and the company's own **A+W Logistics Optimizer** provides access to the functionalities of these solutions.

#### Other Interfaces

The **MS Office connector** enables the export of data from A+W Cantor for further processing.

***

### A+W Cantor Smart Companion

#### Scan Smarter with the Smartphone

The barcode scanner has established itself as an indispensable tool in industry and trade – and also long since in the window, door, and roller shutter industry. From goods receipt to status booking in production on through to delivery to the customer, data is recorded and transferred to ERP systems via barcode reading.

However, there are alternatives to the industrial scanner as we know it, namely smartphones and other smart devices that are equipped with the **A+W Smart Companion app**.

#### A Smart Companion for All Cases, Easier and Cheaper

A+W Smart Companion supports your entire value-creation chain and contributes to its digitalization – so you save time and money. Scanning via smartphone app is easier than with conventional scanners and cheaper too. A+W Smart Companion can fulfill all requirements in the window construction industry without any of the disadvantages of traditional scanner hardware.

Replace specialized, expensive hardware with a familiar mobile device that you use every day. This will also save you time, for no training is required.

The user interface is very simple. You can select everything immediately: the camera mode, the read mode. This simplicity and speed of operation is very important for all employees.

#### Mobile Info Terminal

The app can also be used as a mobile info terminal. For example, you can display the locations of order components and the content of racks, for communication becomes bidirectional.

Invalid bookings due to incorrect read sequence of the barcodes are prevented since the A+W Smart Companion guides the user. This significantly increases read quality.

Another benefit: with the A+W Smart Companion, you can scan several barcodes at a time, e.g. for element labels on a rack. This represents a significant time savings. Work is more productive and fewer errors are made.

#### Your Benefits

* Scan, inform, evaluate – securely and efficiently
* Use on mobile, user-friendly devices
* No learning curve: familiar hardware that everybody uses every day
* Runs on iOS and Android
* Depending on requirements, can be used on various smart devices
* Scanning of several barcodes in continuous mode
* Simpler workflows for employees increase productivity

### Integration with A+W Clarity – Software for Glass

A+W is a full-service provider of software for the manufacture of windows, doors and flat glass. A+W is the only manufacturer to offer integrated solutions for window and glass manufacturers and also highly integrate solutions for order processing between the window fitters and insulating glass supplier.

#### Manufacture of Construction Elements with Own Glass Production

If you, as a window fitter, are your own glass supplier, the integration of A+W Cantor with the A+W production system, **A+W Production for glass**, is the perfect solution for you.

A+W Production for glass makes it possible for you to optimally plan and control your glass manufacturing. Both systems feature paper-free production. Alongside automatic transmission of the necessary glass data, another special feature of integration is complete transfer of insulating glass units from glass production to the window line.

#### Integration with Your Glass Supplier

This integration also works beyond company limits: When creating windows and doors, all required features are generated for the manufacture of the glass. Glass data from A+W Cantor is automatically transferred to the software via an interface. Both systems compare their information using the sequence and rack position of the glass. With A+W Production, the glass manufacturer is capable of producing and documenting the sequence required by the window fitter.

#### Production Control and Monitoring

The window fitter's A+W Cantor software provides the glass supplier with clear sorting identification (e.g., via EDI), concerning the:

* Production line
* Production batch
* Over/under sizes not suitable for pane buffers
* Extremely long delivery times (Tempered glass, processed glass) used to be ordered and sorted
* Separate delivery – glazing on building sites

Panes that are manufactured with A+W Software often display two barcodes: The glass manufacturer's internal one used by A+W Production to guide the glass correctly through the insulating glass production and the second one, which contains information for the window fitter's production logistics. Modern window fitting software, such as A+W Cantor, will generate the barcode information when the glass is ordered and transfer the order via EDI.

Due to the fact that the pane is identified by the barcode registration in the window fitter's system, it can be localized when glazing by scanning the barcode applied to "its" corresponding leaf – the barcode label contains all necessary information and guides the pane exactly when it is needed.
