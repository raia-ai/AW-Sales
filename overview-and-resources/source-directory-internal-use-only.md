# Source Directory (Internal Use Only)

I see you pasted an internal mapping document. What would you like me to do with it?

Here are some options I can perform — pick one or tell me a different goal:

1. Convert this into a cleaned GitBook page (markdown) that maps GitBook pages to their source documents, removing the internal-only disclaimer and any navigation noise.
2. Produce a GitBook-friendly page that hides internal-only warning but keeps the mapping (e.g., using cards for each product suite).
3. Generate a reusable content block (for internal use) that you can include across GitBook pages.
4. Nothing — just confirm you intended to share internal mapping (I will not use it beyond this response).

If you pick option 1 or 2, tell me:

* Do you want the tables preserved as-is, or converted into cards?
* Should I treat the whole page as internal (add a short internal-only hint block) or remove the disclaimer altogether?

If you want, I can immediately produce a sample GitBook-optimized markdown version (table or cards) — say which format you prefer.
