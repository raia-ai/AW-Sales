# A+W Clarity: Software for Glass

## A+W DYNOPT: A Steady Flow of Glass – Optimum Yield

A+W DynOpt is a dynamic optimization system for controlling automatic cutting and sorting lines. The latest A+W DynOpt systems also ensure the seamless communication between cutting and downstream, online-connected production lines.

## Optimum yield with the desired production sequence

### A+W DynOpt functionalities

A+W DynOpt is a dynamic optimization and control system for cutting, breaking, and sorting. As an add-on to A+W Production*, A+W DynOpt optimizes waste to achieve maximum yield, while adhering to a predefined production sequence. It also controls dynamic sorting systems, such as the HEGLA SortJet.

A+W DynOpt allows the simultaneous cutting and breaking of several glass types. The system controls and synchronizes several cutting tables, sorting buffers, and residual lite management systems all while ensuring real-time data exchange with other production systems, such as the insulated glass line.

In combination with a dynamically-controlled intermediate buffer (for example, HEGLA SortJet), a continuous flow of glass is now possible, while also allowing rush orders and remakes to be inserted in a timely fashion with a constant waste ratio. A+W DynOpt couples the previously manual or semi-automatic production flows so that they are completely automatic and thus generates a long-term uninterrupted flow of glass.

With A+W DynOpt, it is now feasible to create any desired sequence without having to reduce profitability. Because of A+W DynOpt, the total yield of your facility is now higher than with your previous optimization system.

### How does A+W DynOpt work?

A+W DynOpt analyzes the existing optimization potential and the current quantity of glass available all while considering the extent to which the dynamically-managed intermediate buffer is filled. The fill level, glass flow, and yield are weighed optimally against one another. This increases the potential of the buffer. The monitor also shows when the next appropriate residual plate will occur. During the ongoing optimization process, additional lites are transferred to production. For example, for a certain glass type with residual plates, there are now three stock plates available for optimization. Automatically or with the touch of a button, A+W DynOpt performs a new optimization in seconds and displays the results on a monitor. Because of this optimization, the residual plate is unavoidable and shifts forward until such time when it is usable. With common glass types, the goal of no residual plates by the end of the day is actually possible thanks to A+W DynOpt. With multiple varieties of glass being processed on a daily basis, automatic residual plate storage (Remaster, Storer, etc.) is recommended and automatically incorporated into the process.

The current generation of A+W DynOpt makes it feasible to exchange glass types and optimize for storage on A-racks, when necessary.

> *A+W Production is a complete production planning and control system for insulated glass, TG, and LG production as well as for multi-level production environments. The basic version of A+W Production includes production as well as close-to-machine rough and detailed scheduling, machine assignment, formula editor, and production release.

## Your benefits:

- Best yield for a desired production sequence
- Improved efficiency of the cutting lines
- Less breakage and damage during cutting and sorting
- Improvement of production-synchronized handling and breakage as well as the integration of rush jobs
- No limits on the size of a production lot (from individual lites through to daily production)
- Controlled output onto one or more harp racks or directly onto one or more insulated glass lines
- Calculates the best way to optimize your fully automatic production line
- Generates a continuous glass flow
- Automatic control of sorters, buffers, and residual plate storage
- Automatic load distribution across several production lines
- Intelligent process optimization through the use of algorithms for perfect, individually-attuned loading of your buffer system
- Everything under control: based on graphic displays, such as planned and current work stock

## A+W DynOpt Basic: The cost-effective starter version of A+W Dynopt without sorting machine

A+W DynOpt Basic is the starter version of A+W DynOpt. In basic mode, A+W DynOpt works directly with racks, which are filled either manually or with a simple sorting system without an intermediate buffer. At least for the major glass types, A+W DynOpt Basic produces excellent glass yield, while avoiding residual lites. This ensures a continuous flow of completed harp racks from the cutting area.
