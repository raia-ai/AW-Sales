long_description: "This document details the features and benefits of the A+W Rack Optimizer, a software system designed for the insulated glass manufacturing industry. It addresses the common industry problem of inefficiently placing finished lites in intermediate storage, which leads to costly and time-consuming re-sorting in the dispatch area. The A+W Rack Optimizer guides the entire production process toward direct, package-optimized packaging. The software divides orders into logical groups (e.g., by delivery date or route) and calculates the optimal placement of lites on transport racks. Users can preview the results in 2D or 3D and make adjustments. The system supports various rack types, including harp and A-racks, and integrates deeply with A+W Enterprise ERP for defining packing rules during order entry. Key benefits highlighted include cost reduction, higher glass yields, increased productivity, and the introduction of a sustainable production organization."
