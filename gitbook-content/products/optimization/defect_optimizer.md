title: "A+W Defect Optimizer"
short_description: "Brochure for A+W Defect Optimizer, a software solution that detects and considers glass defects before cutting to increase yield, improve quality, and reduce costs."
long_description: "This document is a product brochure for the A+W Defect Optimizer. It outlines a common problem in the glass industry: the late discovery of defects in jumbo lites, leading to significant costs from remakes and customer complaints. The proposed solution is a software that integrates with Viprotron scanners to detect defects on stock plates before the cutting process begins. The Defect Optimizer then intelligently adjusts the cutting pattern to avoid these defects, placing smaller or less critical parts on flawed areas if avoidance is impossible. Key benefits highlighted include increased quality through defect prevention, significant cost reduction from early detection, improved delivery reliability, and better supplier quality control. The brochure illustrates this with a before-and-after comparison of a cutting pattern, showing how the software optimizes the layout to work around a detected flaw. The document also includes company information, highlighting A+W's 40+ years of experience and global presence."

# A+W Defect Optimizer

## Detect and consider defects even before cutting

### The Challenge: Costly Defects Discovered Too Late

Do your customers complain about flawed lites/windows after installation? Do you have to report finished units broken after washing due to breaks and inclusions and then re-make them? By now, you would already have incurred significant costs for production (and dispatch) of the lite. And now you must invest in remaking a lite and, if necessary, sending it to the customer again.

Statistically, every second jumbo lite has a defect. However, inclusions and defects on stock and residual lites are frequently detected only very late, for example, during quality control before/after IGU assembly or, in the worst case, at the customer.

### The Solution: Intelligent Pre-Cutting Optimization

Why not detect and consider defects in the optimization stage even before cutting?

## Increase your glass yield and quality – with intelligent defect optimization from A+W

- Together with Viprotron scanners, we scan the stock plate and detect defects even before cutting starts.
- Defects are considered during optimization for a new or restructured cutting pattern.
- Required sequences are considered in the optimization process.
- Information about defects in residual plates is stored and can be used again later without another check.
- If defects cannot be avoided with optimization (number and size of lites on the pattern), then smaller, cheaper glass parts are placed on the defect.
- Pieces of glass that contain defects are automatically reported broken and remade.

## Your benefits:

- Increased quality thanks to defect prevention
- Significant cost reduction by early defect detection
- Prevention of processing on already defective lites
- Selection of suitable suppliers through quality controls
- Increasing of delivery reliability
