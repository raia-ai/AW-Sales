"This document provides a comprehensive overview of the A+W Smart Delivery application, designed to digitize and streamline delivery operations. The system allows drivers to access order information and customers to confirm or reject deliveries via an electronic signature on a mobile device. This digital confirmation immediately updates the A+W ERP system, enabling faster invoicing and improving cash flow. Key features include real-time status updates for deliveries, providing transparency for customers, drivers, and dispatchers. The app also allows for the documentation of deliveries, such as taking photos of damaged goods, which are automatically stored in the ERP. The brochure also details the integration with GPS technology (Nokia Maps) for route optimization and an integrated rack management system. For more advanced needs, the document explains the upgrade path to the A+W Logistics Optimizer, which adds intelligent route optimization considering traffic and truck restrictions. The primary benefits emphasized are scalability, the use of the app as an electronic delivery note, and the acceleration of post-shipping processes like invoicing."

#### A+W Smart Delivery

**Deliver like a Pro**

Digitize your delivery process and shorten billing cycles with the new A+W Smart Delivery app. Why waste valuable time printing delivery notes and obtaining physical signatures when the transactions can be recorded and transmitted straight into your database through the mobile delivery app?

When your customer signs electronically, A+W Smart Delivery confirms receipt of their order. Because the app automatically completes job tickets, you can issue the invoice immediately, so you'll receive payment at least one day earlier. Multiplied by numerous customers and orders, and the cash flow benefits can be significant!

#### Delivery App

A+W Smart Delivery is an app-driven platform that provides real-time information about the status of your deliveries. Customers, drivers, and dispatch benefit thanks to greater visibility and need-based response management.

**Process:** The driver accesses the order and item information, and the customer confirms or rejects the delivery via an electronic signature.

Upon a successful delivery, the order status is immediately updated in your A+W ERP system, enabling you to start the billing process. Valuable information, such as photographs of a damaged delivery, or a rack that has been unloaded at a construction site, can be automatically stored in the ERP system to document deliveries and increase transparency for both you and your customer.

These easy-to-sync features enable you to schedule efficient routes for drop off and pick up, whether you are in the office or on the road.

With minimal effort, A+W Smart Delivery can be upgraded to the A+W Logistic Optimizer, adding an intelligent route optimization tool and more. With A+W Logistics Optimizer, you can optimize routes via traffic information, schedule accurate delivery times, and even re-route around truck restrictions. These tools will increase driver reliability and provide savings in both time and transportation costs.
