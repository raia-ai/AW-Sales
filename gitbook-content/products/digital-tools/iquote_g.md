## Glass orders 24/7

### Mobile, web-based quotation and order entry

A+W iQuote brings your online shop into the future. Your customers can enter and manage quotations and orders 24/7 and view quotation/order status – even when they're on the road. This not only gives you an additional sales channel, it also provides competitive advantages. It reduces the work involved in recalculating quotations and orders and making changes. Depending on the status, your customers can make these changes themselves and also enter notes (for example, a different delivery address or a requested certain delivery date).

### Developed for the A+W ERP system

A+W iQuote follows the rules of your A+W ERP system, with the same prices, feasibility, and plausibility checks that you have defined there.

### A+W iQuote keeps your business rolling

As soon as an online order is entered into your system via A+W iQuote, it is compared with your stocks in real time. Once you have released orders, you can transfer them directly to production, thus eliminating the need for double entry of orders.
