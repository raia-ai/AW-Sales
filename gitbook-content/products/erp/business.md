## A+W Business: Software for Glass

### Even more ergonomic.

A+W Business is a new-generation ERP system for the flat glass industry. Quotations, order processing, purchasing, shipping, and invoicing have never been easier!

### The perfect solution that grows with you

#### A+W Business Functionalities

A+W Business is a complete ERP system for small- and medium-sized companies in the flat glass industry.

The A+W commercial solution allows for not only the entry of quotations, orders, credit notes, complaints, delivery notes, and the management of purchase orders and inquiries, but it also allows for control of other company areas (e. g., stock, purchasing, and dispatch). The main functions of A+W Business are master data management, quotation creation, order processing, creation of partial deliveries and complaints, and all associated documents and evaluations.

#### Graphical Interface and Ease of Use

With its graphic interface, A+W Business is easy and quick to use, while also simplifying all company-internal processes related to order processing.

The system offers extensive technical support for the processing of quotes and orders. Elements are displayed true-to-scale during entry in order to prevent errors and speed up the entire process. Price calculation with A+W Business is very flexible and allows division into standard prices and customer-specific terms.

Additionally, calculation is done automatically, but it can be checked and changed manually.

#### Integration and Expansion

If you are using the A+W Production suite, production information is also available in A+W Business. This includes customer inquiries about delivery date, production utilization, and production process, all of which can be answered quickly and precisely.

Optionally, the A+W Business package can be expanded to include an EDI solution, supplemental CAD functionalities, internal rack management, a Microsoft Outlook connection, and interfaces to various financial accounting and document management systems. Additionally, evaluations in the form of reports and statistics can be created to enhance decision-making tools for management.

The integration of the A+W Logistics Optimizer expands the ERP system to include complete route planning and control (including a delivery app for the driver) and rounds out the entire package in the areas of dispatch and logistics.

Inventory management is supported and expanded with a simple yet high-performance WinCE scanner app.

Through the many possibilities for modular expansion, A+W Business is very scalable—the system adjusts to your needs and grows with you.
