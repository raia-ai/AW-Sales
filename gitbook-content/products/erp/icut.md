## A+W iCut

**Software for Glass**

### Enter orders, Optimize cutting, & Manage storage

Are you looking for a state-of-the-art, cost-effective IT solution that automates your most-used functions in the office, storage, and cutting? Then A+W iCut could become your new integrated software system – perhaps the first step toward digitalizing your company.

Has it occurred to you that even small and medium-sized companies will have to digitalize their processes in order to succeed in the future? Are you looking for a state-of-the-art, cost-effective IT solution that automates your most-used functions in the office, storage, and cutting? Then A+W iCut could become your newly integrated software system - perhaps the first step toward digitalizing your company.

#### Clever entry-level solution for your operation

A+W iCut is a compact solution for insulated glass manufacturers and glass processors that is integrated into commercial programs with state-of-the-art cutting optimization. Use A+W iCut to enter orders and optimize your glass cutting; manage your glass storage and use automatic synchronization with optimization. After cutting, all while A+W iCut automatically updates your inventory. A+W iCut works based on the MS-SQL Express database.

#### Easy order entry

With A+W iCut, you create customers and products easily and quickly and use a clear interface to enter IG, TG, LAMI, and other glass types. For calculation of the correct cutting dimensions, you enter the required edge processings. Do you need to enter a shape? No problem - the standard shapes in the A+W shape catalog are available. For the entry of shaped sheets that are not included in the A+W shape catalog (shape 99), there is a DXF import function. All of this together allows you to calculate the total price for the order based on the item prices entered.

The software interface allows users to:

* Enter sizes, shapes, edge processing and IGU steps
* Use the Production Manager for optimization
* View item prices

#### Intelligent cut optimization

With the integrated Production Manager you transfer the orders entered to optimization with a single mouse-click. That's the default mode of A+W iCut. You can choose between chaotic optimization for the highest yield and sequenced optimization for optimal organization of subsequent processes.

For experienced users, there is also expert mode, which permits control of the individual planning and optimization steps, and thus also of the optimization results.

All commercially available cutting tables can be controlled with A+W iCut optimization. Edge decoating is supported. With appropriate additional drivers, you can also control additional cutting tables.

Broken sheets are re-optimized manually with A+W iCut. Of course, there are also functions for label printing and visualization of cutting plans.

#### This saves you money: residual plate management for optimal material yield

Another crucial feature of A+W iCut is a system for managing residual plates. This ensures that in addition to the stockplates, the optimization also considers your valuable residual plates in order to achieve the best yield.

With all of these functions, A+W iCut optimization proves its value as a high-quality, state-of-the-art solution, all at a very reasonable price.

### Your benefits:

**Order entry**

* Entry of IG, LAMI, TG, and individual sheets
* Entry of edge processings (for calculation of the correct cutting dimensions)
* Entry of standard shapes from the A+W shape catalog
* Calculation of the total order price based on manually entered item prices
* DXF import during order entry with shape 99

**Storage**

* Manual stock receipt bookings
* Automatic stock removals through optimization

**Optimization/use of residual sheets**

* The system offers the opportunity to create and maintain storage of residual plates.
* Residual plates can be added manually to the residual plate storage system. The optimization essentially uses the stored sheets that provide the best result with regard to costs and yield, and only then the residual plates.
* If you wish to use a residual plate despite less advantageous waste and cost factors, this can be controlled manually.

### Do you want more?

One of the best properties of A+W iCut: when your requirements increase, your software solution can "grow along with your needs" if you'd like it to. For example, an upgrade to A+W Business Pro is possible at any time, if your company grows, if you have to manage more customers and products, or if you need more workstations and functions.

But you can also integrate optional add-ons for your existing A+W iCut, such as barcoding/sheet tracing, and A+W iShape for quick and easy digitalization of templates.

A+W Business Pro is a professional, cost-effective solution for small and medium-sized companies that completely integrates order processing and production planning and as well as much more. With the commercial part of this integrated solution, which largely corresponds to the "big" ERP system called A+W Business, you can handle not only the entry of quotations, orders, credits, complaints, delivery notes, and manage orders and inquiries, but you can also take control of other areas (e.g., storage, purchasing, shipping, etc.).
