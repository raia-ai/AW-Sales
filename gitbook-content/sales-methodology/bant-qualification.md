## **Phase 1: S - Situation Questions**

Your first goal is to understand the prospect's current environment. Ask just enough questions to get a clear picture. Don't spend too much time here.

**Example Situation Questions:**

* _"To start, could you tell me a bit about your company and what you manufacture?"_
* _"What software are you currently using to manage your business and production?"_
* _"Can you walk me through your current process, from when an order comes in to when it's delivered?"_
