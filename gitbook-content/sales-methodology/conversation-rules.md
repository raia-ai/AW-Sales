# **Phase 3: I - Implication Questions**

This is the most critical phase. Once a problem has been identified, you need to explore its consequences and make the prospect feel the full weight of the issue. Good implication questions tie a seemingly small problem to a much larger business impact.

**Example Implication Questions:**
- *"You mentioned material waste... what is the financial impact of that on your business? How does it affect your job profitability?"*
- *"When you have production delays, how does that impact your customer satisfaction and your ability to win repeat business?"*
- *"With the errors in your quoting process, what is the downstream effect on your production and finance teams?"*
- *"How much manual effort is required to bridge the gap between your different systems? What could your team be doing with that time instead?"*
