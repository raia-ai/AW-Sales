# Pain Point 1: Excessive Material Waste Due to Poor Cutting Optimization
**Industry Challenge:**
- Glass manufacturers typically experience 10-20% material waste due to inefficient cutting patterns
- Manual cutting optimization is time-consuming and suboptimal
- Generic software doesn't understand glass cutting constraints and breakage patterns
- Leftover materials (residuals) are often discarded rather than reused effectively
