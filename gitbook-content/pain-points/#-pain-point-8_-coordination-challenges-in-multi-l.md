# Pain Point 8: Coordination Challenges in Multi-Level Production
**Industry Challenge:**
- Complex production flows with multiple processing steps are difficult to coordinate
- Bottlenecks in one area affect entire production flow
- Lack of visibility into work-in-process inventory and status
- Difficulty optimizing across multiple production lines and processes

**A+W Solution - Integrated Production Control:**
- **Multi-Level Production Support:** Handles complex workflows with multiple processing steps
- **Real-Time Coordination:** Coordinates activities across all production areas
- **Bottleneck Management:** Identifies and resolves production bottlenecks
- **Flow Optimization:** Optimizes material flow between processes

**Business Impact:**
- **Throughput Improvement:** 15-25% improvement in overall production throughput
- **Reduced WIP:** Lower work-in-process inventory and faster cycle times
- **Better Coordination:** Improved coordination between production areas
- **Predictable Delivery:** More accurate delivery date commitments
